Cut your time in HALF !
------------------------------------

HALF is a framework gathering several resources of active learning libraries and implementing them in a light framework in a Docker image. You just need to add how to load your data and how to create your model and you are ready to go

HALF uses pytorch and pytorch-lightning for the dataset and model respectively. Examples are available in the `Extensions`` folders.
